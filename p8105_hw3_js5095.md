# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.  
The 15 variables include order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order,
reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow,
order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name,
aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department.  
Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

## 1.1 How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
aisle_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

aisle_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
